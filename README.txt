This code is a project by the CyberPatriots design team. It is a project oriented towards the collection, analisation, and use of data
related towards public feelings towards a particular company. It utilises aspects of machine learning, statistics, and data collection.

This program has one main purpose: given a certain data set, it will output the demographic that likes your product the most, and it will
output the demographic that likes your product the least. This is very useful in marketing - you would have no need for demand creation
in some demographics, so you could focus your demand creation on demographics that dislike your product. This project also takes into
account demographic size; even if a small demographic hates your product, you should still focus on the larger demographic that could
use some persuasion.

This code is written by El Segundo High School student Paul Brozenec and the esteemed Computer Science club.
